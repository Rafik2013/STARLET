# STARLET
This is my first project by coding.
In this project you may go trough the maze to win the game.
To go through the maze you should go past the walls and don't touuch them. After you shold kill the enemy to take the treasure.
To move you need use k-down,k-up,k-left,k-right even to shoot you should use the space.
I hope you really enjoy this game. <3
